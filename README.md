# Web Scraping Projects

I have worked on several scraping projects to scrape and automate the formatting of data. Below are a few websites that I have scraped, along with a link to the code base.

## Websites Scraped

You can find the code for these scraping projects on GitHub and Google Drive.
Most of the scraping code is on Google Drive.
